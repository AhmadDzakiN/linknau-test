# Linknau Test
Linknau Test Repository by Ahmad Dzaki Naufal

## Explanation
- All question will have each different go file in questions package
- Check `main.go` file for a **brief explanation** for each number
- Number 1 is in `questions/struct.go`
- Number 2 is in `questions/interface.go`
- Number 3 is in `questions/package_management.go`
- Number 4 is in `questions/auth.go`
- Number 5 is in `questions/number_five.go` and `questions/number_five_test.go`

When you run `go run main.go`, it will execute/run number `1, 2, and 4 sequentially`. For `number 3`, because it is just explanation so you need to open `questions/package_management.go` for the **answers**. For `number 5`, you can run `go test -v ./...` command to run the unit tests.
